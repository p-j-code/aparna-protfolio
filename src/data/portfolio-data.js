        "A typographic book cover uses different styles, sizes and arrangements of letters and words to create a visually appealing design. Instead of relying on images or illustration, it focuses on the art of arranging text creatively. This involves playing with fonts, spacing, colours and layout to convey the mood, theme or essence of the book. 'Calling Sehmat' by Harinder Sikka, inspired by the story of a freedom fighter, utilizes metaphors to illustrate the profound intricacies of life, with the arrangement of alphabets serving as a reflection of this profound narrative thread throughout the book.",
